Features
--------

* Importing the **data** from the train.csv file (691 rows with 10 features)  
* The model was trained with the Random Forest Classifier to determine if a passenger survived.
* The goal was to build a model that would achieve **high prediction accuracy** and **high recall** because you want a model that minimizes the possibility of passengers not being in the focus of rescue activities because they were wrongly classified by the model!
